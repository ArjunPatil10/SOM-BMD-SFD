# SOM-BMD-SFD
Generates BMD and SFD for a specific beam.

In this code, we have a beam with given loading system(refer the image), we have to 
plot the following graphs using the MATPLOTLIB library:
1. BMD
2. SFD
3. Variation of the support reactions at points A and B


Given data :
The beam is under a uniformly distributed load system, as 20KN/m. 
There is a hinge joint at point A and a roller support at point B.
The external load will be called P, whose location will be decided 
by the input from user i.e. we will plot the above graphs for 
P at the location of user's choice. 
The value of the load P will also be decided by the user.
The length of the beam is 6 metres, with the distance AB as 4m
and BC as 2m.
